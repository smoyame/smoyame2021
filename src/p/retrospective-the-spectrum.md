projPrompt: A look back on my first volunteer design position, using my
  present-day design sensibilities.
projDesc: >-
  <p>Using material from the first publication I ever worked on, I decided to
  fine-tune my layout skills as preparation for my degree project.</p>


  <p>During my time at Montgomery College, I was approached to serve as the Editor-In-Chief for our Student Art League. I was just a regular member at the time—helping set-up and take down events, filling in for a sick treasurer here and there—but I dove in and got to learning InDesign before I ever took my first Graphic Design class.</p>


  <p>At times I filled in for writing articles or taking photographs close to their deadline. We were all volunteers who dealt with tests, sleepless study nights, and the like. Things happen, and I did my best to make it work.</p>

      Mountain exhibit's 'Geodesic Dome' by Nasser Mansouri taking up the next
      page beside it.

    imageAlt: A stark, black page with the text 'Select Student Work.' is to the
      left of a single picture of a student piece. The piece illustrates a
      plague-doctor-like figure with a face made of chainmail in pure black and
      white..
