projPrompt: I was challenged to brand an Olympic Games held at a future date.
projDesc: <p>This project brands the 2040 olympics set in Buenos Aires,
  Argentina. Visual callbacks to the Argentinian tradition of Fileteado Porte√±o
  and modular indigenous patterns place an emphasis on unity and peace that the
  Olympics tries to achieve through global sportsmanship.</p>
