projPrompt: I was challenged to create a visual hierarchy for a publication.
projDesc: <p>AMASS magazine is a 14-page publication concept made to capture the
  voices of those less heard and immortalize the infamous that wring them dry.
  It's focused on the divide between actions and consequences when they affect
  the average American instead of a fellow corporate partner.</p>
