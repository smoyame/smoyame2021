projPrompt: I was challenged to conceptualize a broadsheet publication based on
  the content of a literary work.
projDesc: I was challenged to create a newspaper based on the content of a story
  I hold dear to me. The Dry Run is an experimental broadsheet publication that
  is inspired by Daniel Keyes' Flowers for Algernon. This 3-page dry run
  explores Charlie's experiences in the form of complex typographical hierarchy.
