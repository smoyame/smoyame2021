projPrompt: I was challenged to conceptualize a broadsheet publication based on
  the content of a literary work.
projDesc: <p>Flowers for Algernon by Daniel Keyes holds a special place in my
  heart. Taking the themes of the story, I designed a broadsheet publication to
  test my ability to create a cohesive typographic hierarchy system. At the same
  time, I chose to diverge from typical publication norms just enough to convey
  a distance from normalcy while keeping the copy easy to dive into.</p>
