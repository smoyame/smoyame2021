projPrompt: How might we address the stigma against people who live with
  intellectual and developmental disabilities?
projDesc: >-
  <p>It's a big ask.</p>


  <p>The initiative I created as a part of my degree project addresses Down Syndrome in particular due to my sister's personal experiences and my own observations over the course of our lives. Initially, this was a pointed effort to address the lack of funding in public education settings.</p>


  <p>My research and interviews led me to develop and design a piece that would address common-day pain points to tackle where the lack of awareness and funding shortfalls really start to rear their heads.</p>

      Talk' to find out about notable people with Down Syndrome navigating their
      careers. 2 samples of instagram social media posts are on the right,
      asking for people with Down syndrome to be respected instead of
      celebrated; and to be accepted instead of simply having people be aware of
      their presence.
