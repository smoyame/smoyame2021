projPrompt: How might we address the stigma against people who live with
  intellectual and developmental disabilities?
projDesc: >-
  <p>It's a big ask.</p>


  <p>The initiative I created as a part of my degree project addresses Down Syndrome in particular due to my sister's personal experiences and my own observations over the course of our lives. </p>


  <p>My research and interviews led me to develop and design a piece that would address common-day pain points to tackle where the lack of awareness and funding shortfalls really start to rear their heads.</p>

    imageAlt: A phone displays an instagram story that details a 'Living & Live
      Talk' to find out about notable people with Down Syndrome navigating their
      careers. 2 samples of instagram social media posts are on the right,
      asking for people with Down syndrome to be respected instead of
      celebrated; and to be accepted instead of simply having people be aware of
      their presence.

    imageAlt: Two sides of the same card are featured. The Front has a quote from
      bell hooks . The back reads 'Differences are more normal than you think.
      To hear stories from others please visit ds.valivaryus.info' and a
      personal note written thanking someone for listening in the blank space on
      the bottom half of this side of the card.

    imageAlt: A call to action that encourages people to review common
      misconceptions of people who live with Down Syndrome. There is a link to
      an external video. An image fades in from a larger scale to a smaller
      scale and flashes through pairs of people with Down Syndrome screencapped
      from the video being linked.
