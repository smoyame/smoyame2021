projPrompt: How might we address the stigma against people who live with
  intellectual and developmental disabilities?
projDesc: "It's a big ask.\ 


  The Valivaryus Project is an on-going project that I wish to use to tackle
  misunderstandings for various neurodivergencies. The initiative I created as a
  part of my degree project addresses Down Syndrome in particular due to my
  sister's personal experiences and my own observations over the course of our
  lives.

  Initially, this was a pointed effort to address the lack of funding in
  public education settings. My research and interviews led me to develop and
  design a piece that would address common-day pain points to tackle where the
  lack of awareness and funding shortfalls really start to rear their heads.\r
