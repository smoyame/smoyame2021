projPrompt: What makes us close? How do we make connections?
projDesc: >-
  <p>I created items that allude to the closeness we remember being far in the
  past.</p>


  <p>I conceptualized and designed different items for an imaginary gathering based off of an interview. This includes something to announcing the gathering, something to use while gathering with others, and something to take away from the gathering.</p>
