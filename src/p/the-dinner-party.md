projPrompt: How can we foster connections with our loved ones after a year apart?
projDesc: As a result of increased physical distancing during the pandemic,
  we've lost the opportunity to connect with one another in person. In order to
  bridge the gap that has been created between us and those we wish we could see
  in person, I conceptualized and designed different items for an imaginary
  party based off of information I gathered from interviewing someone
  representative of the typical person at one of my gatherings. This includes
  something to announce the gathering, something to utilize during the
  gathering, and something to take home afterward.
